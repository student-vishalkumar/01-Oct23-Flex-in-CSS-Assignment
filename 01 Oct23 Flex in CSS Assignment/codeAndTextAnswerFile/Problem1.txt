Sure, here are three key differences between CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid layout models:

1. **Direction of Layout**:
   - Flexbox: Flexbox is primarily a one-dimensional layout model, meaning it deals with arranging items in either a row or a column.
   - Grid: CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout model, allowing you to define both rows and columns simultaneously, creating a grid of cells where items can be placed.

2. **Item Placement**:
   - Flexbox: Flexbox focuses on the alignment and distribution of items along the main axis (row or column) and the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis).
   - Grid: CSS Grid provides precise control over the placement of items within the grid, allowing items to be placed anywhere on the grid, spanning multiple rows and columns.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Flexbox: Flexbox is great for creating flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and content dimensions, especially for organizing content within a single row or column.
   - Grid: CSS Grid is ideal for creating complex grid-based layouts, such as those found in web applications or magazine-style websites, where items need to be precisely positioned and aligned across multiple rows and columns.

Choosing between Flexbox and Grid depends on the specific layout requirements of your project:
- **Flexbox** is suitable for smaller-scale layouts or situations where you need to align items along a single axis, like navigation bars, flexible card layouts, or vertically aligning content within a container.
- **CSS Grid** is better suited for larger-scale layouts or situations where you need to align items across both rows and columns, such as grid-based galleries, complex forms, or dashboard-style interfaces.

In practice, you might even use both in combination, leveraging the strengths of each layout model where they are most appropriate within your design.
